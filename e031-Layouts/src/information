- The layouts define the distribution that the components will have.
- Every container must have a layout assigned.
- Initially everyone has a defined one, in case we want to work with that.
    * The JFrame has a BorderLayout assigned.
    * And the JPanel a FlowLayout.



----- BorderLayout -----

- The BorderLayout locates the elements in five different zones, north, south, east, west and center.
- Instance:
      BorderLayout borderLayout = new BorderLayout();
      BorderLayout borderLayout = new BorderLayout(x, y);   // Separation between components
- Add items:
      getContentPane().setLayout(borderLayout);
      getContentPane().add(element1, BorderLayout.CENTER);
      getContentPane().add(element2, BorderLayout.NORTH);
      getContentPane().add(element3, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
      getContentPane().add(element4, BorderLayout.EAST);
      getContentPane().add(element5, BorderLayout.WEST);



----- FlowLayout -----

- The FlowLayout places the elements horizontally or vertically.
- Place the elements in a row by dividing the space between them and if there is not enough space, jump to the next row.
- Instance:
        FlowLayout flowLayout = new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 5, 5);    // Alignment and separation between components

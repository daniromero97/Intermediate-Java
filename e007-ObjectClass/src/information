- There is a root class of all others that is named Object.
- It provides some general-purpose methods that all objects can use.

    * The equals() method
          It can be used to compare two objects.
          This comparison is not the same as that provided by the == operator, which only compares if two references to objects point to the same object.
          The equals () method is used to know if two separate objects are of the same type and contain the same data.
          The method returns true if the objects are equal and false otherwise.

    * The toString() method
        Basically it is used to convert an object to string.

    * Other methods that will be explained
    	clone()
        finalize()
        getClass()
        notify()
        notifyAll()
        wait()

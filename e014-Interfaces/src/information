- An interface is a series of public static constants and public methods that are not defined.

- Static public constants, it is not necessary to write "public final" because it is implicit.
- Public methods, it is not necessary to write "public" because it is implicit.

- Interfaces cannot be instantiated, they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
- A class can only extend from a single class but can implement multiple interfaces.

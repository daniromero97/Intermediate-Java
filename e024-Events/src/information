- An event of an object is a message that is thrown when something has happened to the object.
- Events are defined by creating anonymous classes that implement an interface.
- Example:
    * In the following example, an anonymous class is created that implements an interface with two methods,
        one verifies that the speed is not negative and the other shows the modified object.
    * The event is launched every time a speed is set.

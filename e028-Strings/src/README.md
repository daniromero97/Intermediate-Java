- The objects of type String are immutable, that is, once we build the object it can not be modified.
- The chains are stored in a pool of Strings for later use.

- The classes StringBuilder and StringBuffer are similar to the String class, but if they allow you to modify the object.
- If the value of the object is almost not going to change during the execution of the program, the best option is to use the String class.
- If it is going to be modified many times and also we will do it from different threads, we will use the StringBuffer class.
- And if it is going to be modified many times but from the same thread (the most usual), we will use the StringBuilder class.

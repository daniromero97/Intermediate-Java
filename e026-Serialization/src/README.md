- Object serialization allows you to convert an object if your class implements the Serializable interface in a sequence of bytes that can later be read to restore the original object.
- If our class has attributes that are other classes, they should also implement the interface.
- Serialization is maintained even through the network, that is to say that we do not have to worry about the different representations of data in the different computers.
- It supports:
    - Remote invocation of objects (RMI)
    - The persistence of data

- An anonymous class is a class with no name, defined in the same line of code where the object of the class is created.
- This operation is carried out inside a method of another class, therefore the anonymous class is considered as a nested internal class.
- An anonymous class allows you to create an object that implements a particular interface and be able to use it freely without the hassle of having to explicitly define a class.
- Types:
    - Anonymous classes that implement an interface
    - Anonymous classes that derive from an abstract class
    - Anonymous classes that derive from a parent class

- Events are the actions that the user performs when interacting with a program.
- Example: the user presses a button and a form is validated.

- The Listeners are in charge of controlling the events, waiting for the event to take place and performing a series of actions.
- Depending on the type of event we want to control, we will need a Listener or another.

- Each Listener has a series of methods that we must implement.

- Common Listeners:
    * ActionListener (when clicking on a component or enter if it has the focus)
    * ItemListener (when the state of a component changes)
    * KeyListener (by pressing a key)
    * FocusListener (when a component gains or loses focus, that is, it is selected)
    * MouseListener (when performing an action with the mouse)
    * MouseMotionListener (when moving the mouse)
